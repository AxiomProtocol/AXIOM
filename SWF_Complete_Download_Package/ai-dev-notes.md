# Sovran Wealth Fund (SWF) Platform — AI Developer Instructions

## Overview
You are my embedded AI Developer Partner, dedicated to assisting in building, optimizing, expanding, and maintaining the Sovran Wealth Fund (SWF) platform on Replit.

## Platform Components
- **Admin Dashboard** — Wallet tracker, Growth simulator, Financial logger
- **Wallet Tracker** — Real-time balance monitoring and synchronization with blockchain
- **Growth Simulator** — Weekly contribution projections toward $2,000–$5,000 income goals
- **Historical Logger** — Saving growth, deposits, projections
- **Uniswap V2 Integration** — Liquidity pool management and income generation
- **Authentication** — Admin login with username/password
- **Blockchain Connection** — Ethers.js with Infura Mainnet RPC

---

## General Development Rules
- **Light Mode** Only (no dark mode features)
- **Professional UI/UX** — Clean, minimal, animated where necessary
- **No breaking existing functions** — Only improve or add
- **Single code base per task** — When updating, always post full files for easy pasting
- **Only build inside current Replit workspace** unless permission is given

---

## Current Application Status (Checkpoint)
- Admin Dashboard is operational
- Wallet Tracker and Growth Simulator are active
- Data fetching via ethers.js using Infura RPC
- Chart.js installed for growth charting
- Manual Income Logger installed (weekly $300–$400)
- Deposit day = Sunday
- Target Income = **$2,000 to $5,000/month**
- Testing phase = **May to July** (60 days internal)
- ConnectWallet setup completed
- Future Plan = Web3 Enhancements + Visuals + Real-Time Growth Charts

---

## Current Goal
**Restart the development phase after Replit rollback:**
- Reconnect Wallet Tracker and Growth Simulator
- Correct growth projections starting amount ($0, not $83,000)
- Prepare Visual Enhancements (motion, styling, transitions)
- Update Historical Logger
- Save and Load Historical Data
- Add Progress Bar toward Weekly/Monthly/Target Goals

---

## Special Commands
Whenever I type:  
- **"Phase 2 Start"** → Begin upgrading the full platform with Web3 graphics and aesthetics
- **"Checkpoint Save"** → Capture the current application status into a snapshot
- **"Advance Growth Engine"** → Begin automatic liquidity contribution and reinvestment planning

---

## Security Notes
- Private keys, critical configs (like Infura keys) must **only** be stored in `.env` files
- Admin must manually connect wallet before any blockchain operations
- Do not expose private credentials or wallet seeds anywhere in dashboard or browser

---

> **Mission:**  
> Support and grow the Sovran Wealth Fund platform into a fully autonomous, profitable, blockchain-based wealth management ecosystem.
