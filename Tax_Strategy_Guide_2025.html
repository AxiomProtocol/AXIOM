            <h3>How It Works:</h3>
            <p>Instead of paying 15.3% self-employment tax on ALL income, you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay yourself a "reasonable salary" (subject to 15.3% SE tax)</li>
                <li>Take remaining profits as distributions (NO self-employment tax)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example Calculation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Total net income: $200,000</li>
                <li>Reasonable salary: $100,000 (SE tax: $15,300)</li>

        <h2>Strategy #3: Software Development / Axiom Protocol Deductions</h2>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>🎉 HUGE 2025 UPDATE:</strong> Section 174 R&D deduction RESTORED permanently! Software development labor costs can now be immediately deducted instead of amortized over 5 years. This is a game-changer for tech startups.
        </div>

        <h3>Startup Expenses (First Year Only):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Deduct up to <strong>$5,000</strong> in startup costs immediately (market research, advertising, travel, feasibility studies, prototypes)</li>

        <h2>Strategy #4: Universal Deductions (Both Businesses)</h2>

        <h3>Home Office Deduction:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method A - Simplified:</strong> $5 per square foot (max 300 sq ft = $1,500 deduction)</li>
            <li><strong>Method B - Actual Expenses:</strong> Portion of rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance, internet, repairs</li>
            <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Must be dedicated space used exclusively and regularly for business</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Retirement Contributions (Double Benefit: Reduce Taxes + Build Wealth):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SEP IRA:</strong> Up to $66,000 or 25% of net earnings (2025)</li>
            <li><strong>Solo 401(k):</strong> Up to $66,000 ($73,500 if age 50+)</li>
            <li>These reduce taxable income dollar-for-dollar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Health Insurance Premiums:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Deduct premiums for yourself, spouse, and dependents</li>
            <li>Claimed on Form 1040 (not Schedule C)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Professional Services:</h3>

            <li>Conferences, workshops, bootcamps</li>
            <li>Technical books, O'Reilly subscriptions</li>
            <li>Certifications (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, blockchain certifications)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategy #5: QBI Deduction (URGENT - Expires 12/31/2025)</h2>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚠️ URGENT:</strong> The 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction for pass-through entities EXPIRES at the end of 2025 unless Congress renews it.
        </div>

        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Deduct 20% of your qualified business income from both businesses</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> $150,000 total business income × 20% = $30,000 additional deduction</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Strategy:</strong> Accelerate income into 2025 to maximize this deduction while it's still available. After 2025, you may lose this benefit permanently.
        </div>

        <h2>Strategy #6: Year-End Tax Planning (Before December 31)</h2>

        <h3>Accelerate Deductible Expenses:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepay up to 12 months of rent, subscriptions, insurance (deduct immediately under "12-month rule")</li>
            <li>Buy equipment/software before 12/31 to claim 100% bonus depreciation in current year</li>
            <li>Make Q4 retirement contributions before year-end</li>
            <li>Pay outstanding business expenses (accounting, legal, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Planning a $20,000 server/equipment upgrade for Axiom Protocol? Buy before December 31 to deduct in 2025 instead of waiting until 2026.
        </div>

        <h2>Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments</h2>
