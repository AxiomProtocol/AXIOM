# Developer Advantage: $100 → $1000 in 30 Days

## Your Strategic Advantages
- **Access to 10+ billion SWF tokens** across 16 wallets
- **Platform control** - can optimize earning mechanisms

- Use different wallets for different strategies
- Create natural trading volume and activity
- Demonstrate platform usage across multiple accounts

**3. Focus on External Value Creation**
- Your $100 → $1000 goal should focus on creating external revenue
- Use your SWF position to generate outside income streams

## Platform Integration Strategy
