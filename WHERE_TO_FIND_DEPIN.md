## 📊 **Updated Financial Model**

Make sure you see these NEW earnings (not old ones):

| Tier | OLD Earnings | NEW Earnings |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Mobile | $15-35/mo | $15-35/mo (unchanged) |
| Desktop Standard | $40-85/mo | **$50-100/mo** ✅ |
| Desktop Advanced | $70-140/mo | **$85-160/mo** ✅ |
| Professional | $150-280/mo | **$200-380/mo** ✅ |
| Enterprise | $300-600/mo ❌ | **$1,050-1,950/mo** ✅ |

If you see the OLD earnings, the frontend didn't rebuild properly.
