## ⏸️ What's Paused

### Waiting on Funding ($150,000 required)
- [ ] RaaS provider selection (RFP ready to send)
- [ ] Security audits (2 firms identified)
- [ ] Testnet deployment (scripts ready)
- [ ] Token bridge deployment
- [ ] Mainnet launch

### Why Paused?
**Critical dependency:** Smart contract audits cost $75,000 and take 3-6 months.

**Cannot proceed without:**
1. Security audits (non-negotiable for banking/real estate)
2. RaaS provider setup fee (~$50k)
3. Infrastructure testing budget (~$25k)

---

## 📅 Timeline (If Funded)

### Scenario A: Funded by Dec 2025
- **Dec 20, 2025:** Select RaaS provider
- **Jan 1, 2026:** AXM TGE on Arbitrum One (proceeds as planned)
- **Jan-Mar 2026:** Security audits
- **Mar 15, 2026:** Universe testnet launch
- **Apr-May 2026:** Public beta testing
- **June 15, 2026:** Universe mainnet launch

### Scenario B: Funded from TGE Proceeds (Jan 2026)
- **Jan 1, 2026:** AXM TGE on Arbitrum One
- **Feb 2026:** Audit funding available + RaaS selection
- **Mar-May 2026:** Security audits
- **June 2026:** Universe testnet launch
- **July-Aug 2026:** Public beta
- **September 2026:** Universe mainnet launch

### Scenario C: No Funding
- **Jan 1, 2026:** AXM TGE on Arbitrum One
- **Indefinitely:** Continue operating on Arbitrum One (works fine)
- **Future:** Universe deploys when funding available (no rush)

## 💰 Funding Requirements

### One-Time Setup: $150,000
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Security audits (2 firms) | $75,000 |
| RaaS provider setup | $50,000 |
| Infrastructure & testing | $25,000 |

### Monthly Operations: $40,000-60,000
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Sequencer operations | $15,000 |
| Batch posting gas | $10,000-20,000 |
| Monitoring & support | $10,000 |
| Liquidity incentives | $5,000-15,000 |

**Break-Even:** 11 days at 1M tx/day × $0.05 gas = $50k/day revenue

## 🔍 What Works Right Now

### Fully Functional on Arbitrum One
- ✅ 22 smart contracts deployed
- ✅ AXM token (15B hard cap)
- ✅ Staking, governance, compliance modules
- ✅ TGE launching January 1, 2026

**Universe is an UPGRADE, not a requirement.** Axiom works perfectly on Arbitrum One.

**Why upgrade to Universe?**
- 90% lower transaction costs
- AXM as native gas (massive utility boost)
- Full governance control
- Revenue capture (100% of fees vs. 0%)
- Marketing: "First smart city with its own blockchain"

---

## 🚧 Known Gaps (Identified by Architect Review)

### Technical Validation Needed
- [ ] **Proof-of-concept deployment** - Actually deploy to testnet to validate AXM gas works
- [ ] **Fee token pricer implementation** - Rollup chains need ETH/AXM exchange rate oracle
- [ ] **Treasury security model** - MEV protection, circuit breakers, failsafes
- [ ] **Bridge testing** - L2↔L3 token transfers under load

### Procurement Preparation
- [ ] **RFP email template** - Cover letter to send to RaaS providers
- [ ] **Response template** - Structured form for vendors to complete
- [ ] **Reference checks** - Verify RaaS provider claims with existing customers

### Timeline Realism
- [ ] **Audit lead times** - Book slots NOW (typically 3-6 month wait)
- [ ] **Legal review** - Regulatory compliance for L3 deployment
- [ ] **Dependency mapping** - Critical path analysis (what blocks what)

**Architect's verdict:** "Phase 1 materials leave critical gaps that will block RaaS selection."

**Our response:** Acknowledged. Pausing until funding available to address gaps properly.
