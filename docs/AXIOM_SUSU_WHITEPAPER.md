## 1. Executive Summary

Axiom SUSU is a blockchain-powered rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA) protocol that modernizes traditional community savings systems for the digital age. By combining centuries-old financial cooperation practices with transparent smart contract technology, Axiom SUSU enables communities worldwide to build wealth together without reliance on traditional banking infrastructure.

### Key Innovations

- **Three-Tier Trust System**: Interest Hubs, Purpose Groups, and SUSU Circles create graduated trust-building before financial commitment
- **On-Chain Reputation**: Immutable record of participation history, vouches, and contribution reliability
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Trustless payout execution, contribution tracking, and dispute resolution
- **Global Accessibility**: Regional hubs spanning 60+ communities across US states, major cities, and diaspora populations
- **AXM Token Integration**: Native token staking for enhanced yields and governance participation

### Market Opportunity

The global ROSCA market represents over $1 trillion in annual rotating capital, with participation spanning:
- 50+ million Americans participating in informal savings groups
- Billions across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean
- Growing diaspora communities maintaining cultural financial practices

---

## 2. The Problem: Financial Exclusion

### 2.1 The Unbanked and Underbanked

Despite technological advances, billions remain excluded from formal financial services:

- **1.4 billion adults** globally lack access to a bank account
- **55 million Americans** are underbanked, meaning they have accounts but rely on alternative services
- **Credit invisibility** affects 45 million Americans who cannot access loans due to thin credit files

### 2.2 Trust Deficit in Digital Finance

Existing fintech solutions fail to address fundamental human needs:

- **Anonymous platforms** lack the accountability of community relationships
- **Algorithmic credit scoring** excludes those without traditional financial histories
- **Centralized systems** create single points of failure and data exploitation
- **High fees** extract value from the communities they claim to serve

### 2.3 The Diaspora Challenge

Immigrant and diaspora communities face unique barriers:

- **Cross-border complexity** makes traditional savings groups difficult to maintain
- **Currency volatility** erodes purchasing power in home countries
- **Geographic dispersion** breaks the in-person trust networks
- **Remittance fees** consume 6-9% of transferred value

---

## 3. Traditional SUSU/ROSCA Systems

### 3.1 Historical Context

Rotating savings and credit associations have existed for centuries across diverse cultures:

| Region | Local Name | Characteristics |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| West Africa | Susu, Esusu | Weekly contributions, community-based |
| Caribbean | Pardner, Box Hand | Monthly cycles, diaspora connections |
| Latin America | Tanda, Cundina | Family-oriented, religious community ties |
| South Asia | Chit Fund | Auction-based payout determination |
| East Asia | Hui, Kye | Business-focused, investment orientation |
| Middle East | Jam'iyya | Interest-free, Islamic finance compatible |

### 3.2 How Traditional SUSU Works

1. **Formation**: A trusted organizer gathers 10-20 participants
2. **Contribution**: Each member contributes a fixed amount each cycle (weekly/monthly)
3. **Payout**: One member receives the entire pool each cycle
4. **Rotation**: Process continues until everyone has received once
5. **Completion**: The cycle ends and may restart with the same or different members

**Example**: 10 members contribute $100 monthly. Each month, one member receives $1,000. After 10 months, everyone has contributed $1,000 and received $1,000.

### 3.3 Limitations of Traditional Systems

While effective, traditional SUSU faces challenges:

- **Trust dependence**: Relies on personal relationships that don't scale
- **No enforcement**: Members who default have no accountability mechanism
- **Record-keeping**: Paper-based tracking prone to disputes
- **Geographic limits**: Requires physical proximity
- **Informal status**: No legal protections for participants

## 4. The Axiom SUSU Solution

### 4.1 Vision

Axiom SUSU creates trustworthy digital savings circles by solving the core challenge: **How do strangers build enough trust to save together?**

Our answer is a graduated trust-building system where:
1. People first connect through shared regional identity
2. They discover others with similar financial goals
3. They build reputation through vouches and verified interactions
4. Only then do they commit capital to a savings circle

### 4.2 Core Principles

**Community-First Design**
- Discovery begins with human connection, not financial transactions
- Trust is earned through transparent participation over time
- Every member has a voice in group governance

**Transparency Through Blockchain**
- All contributions recorded on-chain permanently
- Payout schedules publicly verifiable
- Reputation scores cannot be manipulated

**Accessibility Without Compromise**
- No credit checks or banking history required
- Contribution amounts from $10 to $10,000+ monthly
- Cycle lengths from daily to monthly

**Cultural Respect**
- Preserves the community essence of traditional SUSU
- Supports diaspora connections across borders
- Accommodates regional variations in practice

---

## 5. Three-Tier Trust Architecture

Axiom SUSU implements a progressive trust-building framework with three distinct layers:

### 5.1 Tier 1: Interest Hubs

**Purpose**: Geographic and cultural community discovery

Interest Hubs are regional gathering spaces where users connect with others who share their location or cultural background. They serve as entry points to the Axiom SUSU ecosystem.

**Features**:
- 60+ pre-seeded regional hubs covering US states, major cities, and diaspora communities
- Member directories with public profiles
- Community announcements and discussions
- No financial commitment required

**Regional Categories**:
- **US States**: California, Texas, New York, Florida, Georgia, etc.
- **US Cities**: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, etc.
- **Diaspora**: Nigerian Diaspora, Jamaican Diaspora, Filipino Diaspora, etc.

**User Journey**:
1. Connect wallet and create profile
2. Browse available hubs by region
3. Join hubs matching your location or heritage
4. Explore member profiles and begin networking

### 5.2 Tier 2: Purpose Groups

**Purpose**: Goal-aligned pre-commitment communities

Purpose Groups form within Interest Hubs around specific savings objectives. Members share not just geography but financial goals.

**Purpose Categories** (12 preset categories):
1. Emergency Fund
2. Home Down Payment
3. Business Startup
4. Education / Tuition
5. Wedding / Celebration
6. Medical Expenses
7. Vacation / Travel
8. Vehicle Purchase
9. Debt Payoff
10. Investment Pool
11. Family Support
12. Retirement Savings

**Group Parameters**:
- Contribution amount (e.g., $100/month)
- Contribution currency (AXM or approved ERC20)
- Cycle length (Daily, Weekly, Bi-Weekly, Monthly)
- Member capacity (2-50 members)
- Minimum activation threshold (default: 3 members)

**Standardized Naming**: `{Region} | {Purpose} | {Amount} {Currency} | {Cycle}`
Example: "Atlanta, GA | Home Down Payment | 500 AXM | Monthly"

**User Journey**:
1. Join a Purpose Group matching your goal and budget
2. Create a detailed member profile
3. Participate in group discussions
4. Give and receive vouches from other members
5. Build reputation through consistent engagement

### 5.3 Tier 3: SUSU Circles

**Purpose**: Active on-chain rotating savings

SUSU Circles are the culmination of the trust-building process. Purpose Groups that meet activation criteria can "graduate" to become on-chain SUSU Circles with binding smart contract commitments.

**Graduation Requirements**:
- Minimum member threshold met
- All members have confirmed commitment
- Group has been active for minimum trust-building period
- Payout order determined (sequential or randomized)

**Circle Features**:
- Smart contract-enforced contribution collection
- Automatic payout distribution
- Grace periods for late payments
- Default tracking and reputation impact
- Protocol fee routing to Axiom Treasury

**User Journey**:
1. Purpose Group initiates graduation vote
2. Members confirm on-chain commitment
3. Smart contract deployed with group parameters
4. Contributions collected each cycle
5. Payouts distributed automatically
6. Reputation updated based on participation
7. Circle completes when all members have received

---

## 6. Technical Infrastructure

## 7. Smart Contract Design

### 7.1 Pool Configuration

```solidity
struct PoolConfig {
    address token;           // Contribution token (AXM or ERC20)
    uint256 contributionAmount;  // Fixed contribution per cycle
    uint256 cycleDuration;   // Cycle length in seconds
    uint256 gracePeriod;     // Late payment allowance
    uint8 maxMembers;        // Maximum participants (2-50)
    bool randomOrder;        // Payout order randomization
}
```

### 7.2 Member Tracking

```solidity
struct Member {
    address wallet;
    uint256 joinedAt;
    uint256 contributionsMade;
    uint256 payoutReceived;
    bool hasDefaulted;
    uint8 latePayments;
}
```

### 7.3 Pool Lifecycle

1. **Created**: Pool deployed with configuration
2. **Funding**: Members join and lock initial contribution
3. **Active**: Cycles execute with contributions and payouts
4. **Completed**: All members have received payout
5. **Closed**: Pool finalized and funds distributed

### 7.4 Payout Order Determination

**Sequential Order**: Members receive payouts in order of joining

**Randomized Order**: Chainlink VRF generates verifiable random order at pool activation

### 7.5 Default Handling

Members who miss contributions:
1. Grace period allows late payment with no penalty
2. After grace period, contribution marked as missed
3. Three missed contributions trigger default status
4. Defaulted members excluded from current cycle payout
5. Reputation severely impacted for future participation

---

## 8. Trust and Safety Framework

### 8.1 Member Profiles

Every participant creates a comprehensive profile:

**Required Fields**:
- Wallet address (verified via SIWE)
- Display name

**Optional Fields**:
- Bio and purpose statement
- Occupation and skills
- Location
- Social links
- Contact preferences (email, phone, WhatsApp)

**Privacy Controls**:
- Granular visibility settings per field
- On-chain identity verification optional
- Pseudonymous participation supported

### 8.2 Reputation System

Reputation scores reflect trustworthiness across multiple dimensions:

**Contribution Score** (0-100):
- On-time payments: +10 points each
- Late payments: +5 points each
- Missed payments: 0 points
- Defaults: -50 points

**Participation Score** (0-100):
- Circles completed: +20 points each
- Active circle membership: +5 points/month
- Group engagement: +1-5 points/action

**Social Score** (0-100):
- Vouches received: +10 points each
- Vouches given to reliable members: +5 points each
- Vouches given to defaulters: -10 points each

**Composite Reputation**: Weighted average displayed publicly

### 8.3 Vouch System (Trust Attestations)

Members build trust through vouches:

**Giving a Vouch**:
- Select member from group
- Provide optional message
- Vouch recorded on-chain
- Cannot be revoked (but can be marked as regretted)

**Vouch Weight**:
- New member vouch: 1x weight
- Experienced member vouch: 2x weight
- Circle completer vouch: 3x weight

**Vouch Accountability**:
- If vouched member defaults, voucher's score decreases
- Encourages careful, honest attestations

### 8.4 Group Health Dashboard

Real-time metrics for group assessment:

**Readiness Indicators**:
- Member count vs. minimum threshold
- Profile completion percentage
- Vouch network density
- Average reputation score

**Risk Indicators**:
- New member percentage
- Low reputation members
- Unvouched members
- Previous default history

**Payout Timeline**:
- Visual calendar of expected payouts
- Member position in rotation
- Estimated completion date

### 8.5 Graduation Checklist
