1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Axiom SUSU is a blockchain-based coordination protocol designed to modernize traditional rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA) systems through transparent rules, shared accountability, and non-custodial smart contracts.

Rather than replacing long-standing community finance traditions, Axiom SUSU preserves their social foundation while addressing limitations related to scale, record-keeping, cross-border participation, and dispute resolution.

Axiom SUSU does not operate as a bank, lender, investment vehicle, or financial intermediary. It provides infrastructure for voluntary, community-organized savings rotations where participation, contributions, and payouts are governed by predefined rules visible to all members.

Core Characteristics
• Progressive trust-building before financial commitment
• Transparent coordination and verifiable rules
• Non-custodial participation by design
• Cultural continuity across regional and diaspora communities
• Composable infrastructure within the broader Axiom Protocol


2. THE PROBLEM: FINANCIAL EXCLUSION AND COORDINATION RISK

Large segments of the global population rely on informal savings systems due to limited access to traditional financial institutions, cultural preference, or distrust of centralized intermediaries.

While effective, informal systems face persistent challenges:
• Trust that does not scale beyond personal relationships
• Limited transparency and record-keeping
• Geographic constraints
• Lack of standardized dispute handling
• No portable reputation across groups

Modern financial platforms often fail these communities by imposing centralized control, extractive fees, or opaque decision-making.


3. TRADITIONAL SUSU / ROSCA SYSTEMS

Rotating savings systems have existed for centuries across cultures, including:
• West Africa: Susu, Esusu
• Caribbean: Pardner, Box Hand
• Latin America: Tanda
• South Asia: Chit systems
• East Asia: Hui
• Middle East: Jam'iyya

In all forms, participants contribute equally and receive equally over time. There is no profit generation, only coordination of savings timing.

Axiom SUSU preserves this principle.


4. THE AXIOM SUSU APPROACH

Axiom SUSU addresses the core coordination challenge of modern ROSCA participation:

How do people build trust before committing money?

The protocol introduces a graduated participation model where users:
1. Connect through shared geography or identity
2. Engage around common financial goals
3. Build participation history and reputation
4. Enter savings circles only after trust thresholds are met

This ensures that financial coordination follows social validation, not the reverse.


5. THREE-STAGE PROGRESSION

Axiom SUSU uses a graduated approach where trust and commitment build over time. Members progress through three distinct stages, each with its own graduation requirements.

Stage 1: Purpose Groups  
Goal-aligned pre-commitment groups where members discuss savings objectives and establish expectations. Members join through regional Interest Hubs (geographic filters for discovery) and build trust through vouches, profile completion, and group engagement. No financial commitment occurs at this level.

Stage 2: SUSU Circles  
On-chain rotating savings groups activated only after predefined readiness conditions are met. Members choose between two custody modes:
• Personal Vault (Self-Custody): Upfront commitment with segregated funds
• Community Pool (Pooled Custody): Pay-as-you-go with traditional pooled structure

Smart contracts enforce contribution schedules and automate payouts.

Stage 3: The Wealth Practice  
After completing 3+ successful SUSU rounds OR 6+ months with all members in good standing, groups graduate into The Wealth Practice. This unlocks access to larger financial opportunities including real estate pools, DePIN infrastructure investments, and enhanced governance participation within the Axiom ecosystem.

This architecture ensures that financial commitment follows social validation, and larger opportunities follow demonstrated reliability.


6. TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

Axiom SUSU operates on Ethereum-compatible networks optimized for transparency and cost efficiency.

• Smart contracts define contribution rules and rotation schedules
• Off-chain services support discovery, messaging, and analytics
• Wallet-based participation enables user-controlled access

The protocol is modular and designed to evolve alongside the broader Axiom ecosystem.


7. SMART CONTRACT COORDINATION

Smart contracts are used to:
• Register group parameters
• Record contributions
• Enforce rotation order
• Emit immutable participation records

Smart contracts do not guarantee outcomes, insure funds, or replace participant responsibility.


8. TRUST AND SAFETY FRAMEWORK

Trust is reinforced through:
• Profile-based participation
• Contribution history tracking
• Non-financial reputation indicators
• Group-level readiness metrics

Reputation reflects coordination reliability, not creditworthiness or financial status.


9. TOKEN INTEGRATION (CLARIFIED)

AXM may be used as a utility and governance asset within the broader Axiom ecosystem.

Clarifications:
• SUSU participation does not require token ownership
• Token use does not create profit expectations
• No yield, APR, or guaranteed return is implied
• Tokens do not represent ownership of pooled funds

Token functionality is separate from SUSU outcomes.


10. GOVERNANCE MODEL

Governance operates at two levels:

Circle-Level Coordination  
Members agree on rules and resolve issues according to predefined processes.

Protocol-Level Governance  
Infrastructure updates and parameter changes managed separately.

Participation does not grant ownership of the protocol itself.


11. RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Participants should understand:
• SUSU participation involves coordination risk
• Missed contributions affect group outcomes
• Smart contract systems carry technical risk
• Participation is voluntary and rule-based

Axiom SUSU emphasizes transparency, not risk elimination.


12. REGULATORY POSITIONING

Axiom SUSU is presented as:
• Infrastructure for voluntary savings coordination
• Not a bank, lender, broker, or investment platform
• Not a substitute for regulated financial services

Participation involves equal contribution and receipt, without profit derived from others' efforts.


13. ROADMAP

Future development areas may include:
• Improved discovery tools and regional hub expansion
• Enhanced group analytics and reputation tracking
• Broader network support and cross-chain compatibility
• Deeper integration with The Wealth Practice ecosystem
• Capital Mode opportunities for graduated groups
• Real estate and DePIN investment pools

All features are subject to testing, governance review, and legal evaluation.


14. CONCLUSION

Axiom SUSU modernizes a time-tested financial coordination practice without removing its human foundation.

By combining community, transparency, and rule-based execution, the protocol enables people to organize savings responsibly in a digital environment without reliance on centralized trust.

Trust first.
Coordination second.
Capital last.
Wealth together.
