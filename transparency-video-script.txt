VIDEO SCRIPT - AXIOM TRANSPARENCY

---

OPENING TEXT (on screen):
They took everything.

---

VOICEOVER:

You trusted them. They promised the future. Then they disappeared... with your future.

We've watched families lose their savings. Dreams stolen. Trust shattered.

So we asked ourselves one question...

TEXT ON SCREEN:
What if we built something for YOU?

Every contract. Verified. On-chain. For everyone to see.

Twenty-three smart contracts. Not hidden. Not locked away. PROVEN.

Your money doesn't move unless multiple people agree. No one person. No escape.

Twenty-two layers of protection. Built by people who've seen the pain and refused to cause more.

---

SPEAKING TO CAMERA:

I didn't build Axiom to get rich.

I built it because my neighbor lost everything in a rug pull. Because my cousin trusted the wrong project. Because I'm tired of watching good people get hurt.

This isn't just transparency. This is a promise. You come first. Before profits. Before hype. Before everything.

---

VOICEOVER:

America's first on-chain smart city. Where every dollar is tracked. Every decision is voted on. Every person matters.

TEXT ON SCREEN:
Don't trust. VERIFY.

---

SPEAKING TO CAMERA:

Our Token Generation Event is coming. But we're not asking you to trust us blindly.

Go to our Transparency page. See the contracts yourself. Read the security audits. Verify everything.

And when you're ready, join a community that puts you first.

---

CLOSING VOICEOVER:

Because you deserve better. And we're going to prove it.
