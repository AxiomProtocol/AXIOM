Yes, we can absolutely slim this thing down. Right now you have a beautiful empire of contracts, but it is a bit “every ministry gets its own building.” We can merge quite a few into larger, more powerful modules without losing clarity.

Goal: keep the system modular and auditable, but reduce overhead and deployment friction.

I will lay out a concrete refactor that takes you from fifty contracts down to roughly eighteen to twenty.

No code yet, just architecture.

———————— High level approach ————————

We merge contracts along three axes.

1. Domain
All real estate tokenization logic lives together, all DePIN logic together, all realtor logic together, etc.


2. Role and permissions
Anything that uses the same admin or council and the same access model can be fused into one module with internal enums and flags instead of separate contracts.


3. Storage patterns
Instead of one contract per “registry,” we use one registry with multiple record types and configuration structs.



This keeps everything aligned with your Admin Safe and Compliance Safe roles while reducing deployment count.

———————— Proposed new architecture ————————

I will map from old to new in words.

A. Core and identity layer

1. AxiomTokenCore
This is your current Axiom Option C contract, basically unchanged except for small polish. It remains the monetary spine.

Contains
– AXM token logic
– FeeConfig and routing
– Max supply
– Roles like fee manager, oracle manager, treasury role


2. IdentityAndComplianceHub
Combine
– DID registry
– Identity registry for token and city
– Compliance adapter
– Resident registry
– Business license registry

Internally this hub has tables like
– didByAddress
– resident profiles
– business profiles
– verification flags and jurisdiction flags
– compliance checks entry points used by AxiomTokenCore and other modules

Result: every “is this entity allowed to do this” question goes through a single contract.



B. Governance and policy layer

3. GovernanceCouncilAndTimelock
Combine
– Governance council
– Timelock guard
– City DAO governance for the smart city
– Parameter store for onchain configuration (so other contracts can read policy knobs)

One module handles proposals, voting, execution delay, and writes updated settings into a parameter mapping that other modules read.



C. Treasury, funds, and bonds

4. TreasuryAndRevenueHub
Combine
– Treasury manager
– Axiom revenue router
– City treasury hub
– High level budget categories
– Mapping of revenue sources to destinations

This becomes the one place that knows
– which vaults exist
– which percentages of which revenue stream go where
– how staking, property, DePIN, and city services feed AXM into the treasury.


5. CapitalPoolsAndFunds
Combine
– Real Estate Acquisition Fund
– DePIN infrastructure fund
– Liquidity support fund
– City bond vault

Each fund is a record inside this module with
– pool id
– type enum (property, DePIN, bonds, mixed)
– accepted assets
– investor accounting
– payout curves.



D. Staking, emissions, and liquidity

6. StakingAndEmissionsHub
Combine
– AXM staking pool
– Emissions vault
– Claim portal

Internally supports
– multiple staking pools (governance, LP, node operator, realtor)
– per pool reward rate config
– claim logic that pulls rewards from the emissions subpool.


7. LiquidityAndIncentivesVault
Combine
– Liquidity vault
– Owner liquidity facilitator
– Some of the reward router hooks

Any AXM or LP token liquidity incentives flow through here.



E. DePIN and nodes

8. DePINNodeSuite
Combine
– Node license NFT
– Node registry
– Node analytics reference
– DePIN reward router

The NFT is one token type in this module.
Node metadata, performance scores, and payout splits are all handled in one place.


9. OracleAndMetricsRelay
Combine
– Oracle relay
– Emergency services oracle for the smart city
– Utility metrics oracle entry points

This keeps external data bridging in one contract, and everyone else just calls clean view functions.



F. Property, KeyGrow, and leases

This is the big cluster, but it can be collapsed quite well.

10. LandAndAssetRegistry
Combine
– Land parcel registry
– Asset tokenization registry
– Title NFT
– Property share token registration
– Off chain document hashes

It handles
– parcels
– building ids
– ownership mapping
– link between parcels and fractional tokens.


11. PropertyFinanceEngine
Combine
– Property share token factory
– Equity ledger
– Fractional equity market
– Refinance adapter

All tokenized equity and financing flows live here.


12. LeaseAndRentEngine
Combine
– KeyGrow lease manager
– Rent to own engine
– Payment escrow
– Maintenance escrow
– Vacancy reserve
– Tenant booster
– Referral rewards

This is the “income side” of property.
It collects rent, splits it between owners, reserves, and treasury, and integrates with StakingAndEmissionsHub when needed.



G. Realtor and marketplace

13. RealtorModule
Combine
– Realtor profile registry
– Realtor badge NFT
– Realtor referral router
– Visibility boost staking
– Realtor reputation oracle
– Realtor council logic

One module with
– profiles
– badges
– reputation scores
– staking for boosted visibility
– council style escalation for disputes.



H. Smart city services

14. UtilityAndMeteringHub
Combine
– Utility meter registry
– Utility billing router
– Energy grid manager
– Water rights registry

Different meter types are just types and configs inside this module.
It issues bills in AXM and routes share to TreasuryAndRevenueHub and CapitalPools.


15. TransportAndLogisticsHub
Combine
– Smart transportation router
– Trucking router from the original design
– Any drone or on demand mobility node logic

Bridges your Sovran Logistics trucking vision directly with DePIN and city services.


16. CitizenAndCredentialRegistry
Combine
– Citizen passport style IDs (city residency)
– Education and skill credentials
– Civic reputation and participation

This plugs back into IdentityAndComplianceHub and GovernanceCouncil for voting rights and benefits.



I. Cross chain and launch

17. CrossChainAndLaunchModule
Combine
– AXIOM Launchpad
– Cross chain bridge adapter

Separate from or integrated with a canonical LayerZero or Orbit style bridge, depending on final tech choice.
It manages
– TGE
– vesting
– cross chain mint and burn of wrapped assets.



If you want to keep strict separation between TGE and bridging, this could be two contracts, but functionally one module can handle both.

So we end up around seventeen contracts, possibly eighteen if we split a very big one for audit and size limits.

———————— Why this is a good consolidation ————————

1. Fewer things to deploy, verify, and upgrade.


2. Each contract now maps to a real world ministry. Easy to explain in docs and to auditors.


3. You reduce cross contract call complexity, but still keep clean separation of responsibility.


4. It plays nicely with your Safe based role model
– Admin Safe controls governance, treasury, and parameter changes
– Compliance Safe is wired where KYC, policy, and operational vaults live.


5. When you later do Orbit chain stuff, running indexers and subgraphs on this is much easier. Each module emits well scoped events instead of a spiderweb of tiny contracts.



———————— Next move

If this architecture feels right, the next step is to pick one cluster and start turning it into code.

The most natural order is

1. AxiomTokenCore (already done)


2. IdentityAndComplianceHub


3. TreasuryAndRevenueHub


4. StakingAndEmissionsHub


5. LandAndAssetRegistry plus LeaseAndRentEngine



Once those are in place, you already have a functional smart city economy on chain and can progressively add DePIN, realtor, and utility modules without blocking the land acquisition phase.
