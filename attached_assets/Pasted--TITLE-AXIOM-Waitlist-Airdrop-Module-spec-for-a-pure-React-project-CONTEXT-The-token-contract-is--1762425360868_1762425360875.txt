TITLE
AXIOM Waitlist Airdrop Module — spec for a pure React project

CONTEXT
The token contract is Sovran Wealth Fund SWF rebranded to AXIOM. Contracts are already deployed or available locally. Reuse existing contracts in the repo. Look in the contracts folder for token, staking, referral or distributor contracts that can support an airdrop claim, staking boost, and on-chain accounting. If functions are missing, design adapters in the frontend to call the closest equivalents and note gaps.

GOAL
Add a growth airdrop to the waitlist page that increases conversions and referrals while staying GENIUS Act compliant. The airdrop must support tiers, referral tracking, staking boost, progress visuals, and an optional mystery multiplier. Everything is client-side React with ethers.js and the project’s existing wallet connector.

TECH AND CONSTRAINTS

Pure React components only; do not inject raw HTML strings.

Use the project’s existing styling system and theme tokens.

Use ethers.js already in the project for on-chain reads and writes.

Keep all environment values in .env files, not hardcoded.

Respect existing routing and state patterns. If none, use React Context or Zustand.

No server code. Where server endpoints are referenced, assume the project already has an API layer; define the contracts for those endpoints only.


CONTRACT INTEGRATION CHECKLIST

Inspect contracts folder for the rebranded SWF token now AXIOM. Identify

ERC20 interface or custom functions for mint, claim, transfer restrictions

Any Distributor, MerkleAirdrop, RewardsVault, Staking, or Referral contracts

Any Pausable, Ownable, AccessControl roles needed for claims


Record the addresses in a config file per network

PEAQ main or test network if applicable

BSC or Polygon if bridges exist


For airdrop claims, prefer a Merkle-based or signature-based pattern. If neither exists, specify a ClaimRegistry mapping address to amount and include a read-only check that disables the claim button.


DATA AND CONFIG
Create airdrop.json in a config folder with

programStart, programEnd, totalPool, poolSymbol, decimals

tier rules and rewards

stakingBoost rules

mysteryMultiplier min and max

eligibility gates KYC required, email verified, wallet screened

copy strings for all UI text


STATE MANAGEMENT
Create AirdropStore using Context or Zustand that holds

user wallet address, connection status, chain id

user profile from waitlist email if available

KYC status pending, approved

referralCode for the current user

counts for referrals, verifiedReferrals

tier currentTier and progress to next

on-chain balances: tokenBalance, stakedBalance, claimableAmount

program stats claimedTotal, participants, time remaining
Expose actions connectWallet, fetchUserState, claimAirdrop, stakeClaimed, generateReferralLink, copyLink, syncKYC, refreshStats.

USER FLOWS

Visitor lands on the waitlist page
1 Connects wallet. If on wrong chain, show guided network switch.
2 Enters email or confirms existing waitlist profile.
3 Gets a personal referral link format axiomprotocol.app/waitlist r userId or r wallet.
4 Sees current tier, progress to next, and what to do to upgrade.

Claim flow
1 Run client checks KYC ok, wallet screened ok via API, within dates.
2 Read on-chain allowance to claim from Distributor or compute Merkle proof from airdrop list served by API.
3 Enable Claim button. On success, refresh token balance and mark as claimed in UI.
4 Offer stake now with boost; call staking contract stake function with claimed amount.

Referral flow
1 Copy link.
2 When a new user joins through the link and verifies email and wallet, increment verifiedReferrals and update tier.

Mystery multiplier
1 If enabled, request a server-signed multiplier for the user within min max bounds.
2 Add preview of potential bonus and reveal at launch or after staking.


BACKEND ENDPOINT CONTRACTS TO CALL FROM THE FRONTEND
Define these as fetch methods in an api client module. Replit AI should not write server code, only define usage.

GET api waitlist me returns profile, KYC status, referralCode, stats

POST api waitlist join body email, wallet returns profile

GET api airdrop status returns programStart, programEnd, totalPool, claimedTotal, participants

GET api airdrop claim-info params wallet returns merkleProof or signed payload and claimableAmount

POST api referrals record body referrer, referee, status returns updated counts

GET api leaderboard params window weekly alltime returns list of entries

GET api compliance wallet-screen params wallet returns pass or fail

GET api bonus mystery params wallet returns multiplier if eligible


WALLET AND CHAIN BEHAVIOR

Use the app’s existing connector. If none, specify RainbowKit or Wagmi style connectors but do not add code.

Validate network is the one where AXIOM token and Distributor contracts live.

For PEAQ or other non-EVM chains in the future, isolate web3 calls behind an adapter.


TIERS AND REWARDS

Bronze join waitlist and connect wallet reward 50 AXIOM

Silver complete KYC or two verified referrals reward additional 100 AXIOM

Gold become Founding Member or list a property reward additional 500 AXIOM

Platinum bring ten verified referrals or onboard a wholesaler reward additional 1000 AXIOM plus entry to a shared revenue pool if contract exists

All rewards are additive and displayed as pending until compliance checks return true.


STAKING BOOST

If user stakes any amount of claimed tokens within the promotional window defined in config, apply a two times APY boost for sixty days.

Do not calculate APY client-side; read it from staking contract or a config endpoint.

Display boost end date and a countdown.


LEADERBOARD AND PROGRESS BAR

Leaderboard uses API data. Keep identities pseudonymous by default.

Progress bar uses claimedTotal divided by totalPool; include an animated tick when numbers update.

Show remaining supply and end date.


GENIUS ACT AND COMPLIANCE GUARDRAILS

Before claim enablement show three checks
1 KYC AML via Persona status approved
2 Wallet screening pass via Chainalysis status green
