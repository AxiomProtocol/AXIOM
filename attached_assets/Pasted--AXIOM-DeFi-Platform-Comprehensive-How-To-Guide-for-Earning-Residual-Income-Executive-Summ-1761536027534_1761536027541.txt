## **Chapter 2: Technical Architecture & System Design**  

### **AXIOM Infrastructure Overview**  
The AXIOM DeFi platform is built upon a robust technical foundation designed to ensure security, scalability, and seamless user experience. Below is a high-level overview of the architecture:  
- **Frontend**: Developed using React 18, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS for modern, responsive user interfaces.  
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js power the server-side logic and API endpoints, integrated with PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM.  
- **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contracts written in Solidity, deployed using Hardhat, and secured with OpenZeppelin libraries.  
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Storage and Storacha provide reliable data storage and Web3 integration.  
- **Payment Gateways**: Stripe and Binance Smart Chain (BNB) enable dual payment rails.

### **Smart Contract Architecture**  

AXIOM's smart contract layer consists of 43 Solidity-based contracts, each designed to perform specific functions within the platform. Below is an overview of key contracts:  

#### **Example: AXIOMRevenueRouter.sol**  
The `AXIOMRevenueRouter` contract is responsible for automated revenue distribution across stakeholders. Below is a snippet of the contract:  

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT  
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;  

contract AXIOMRevenueRouter {  
    address public owner;  
    mapping(address => uint256) public revenueShares;  

    constructor() {  
        owner = msg.sender;  
    }  

    function setRevenueShare(address stakeholder, uint256 amount) public {  
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set revenue shares");  
        revenueShares[stakeholder] = amount;  
    }  

    function distributeRevenue() public payable {  
        uint256 totalRevenue = msg.value;  
        for (address stakeholder in revenueShares) {  
            uint256 share = revenueShares[stakeholder];  
            payable(stakeholder).transfer(share * totalRevenue / 100);  
        }  
    }  
}  
```

### **Backend Services**  

The backend layer consists of 29 services, such as `liquidityRewardsVaultService.js` and `taxService.js`, which handle critical functions like staking rewards distribution and automated tax reporting. Below is an example service implementation:  

#### **Example: dynamicAPRService.js**  

```javascript  
const calculateDynamicAPR = (stakeAmount, duration) => {  
    const baseRate = 0.05; // Base APR rate (5%)  
    const durationBonus = duration > 12 ? 0.02 : 0.01;  
    return baseRate + durationBonus + (stakeAmount / 100000);  
};  

module.exports = { calculateDynamicAPR };  
```  

---

### **Frontend Design**  

The AXIOM frontend utilizes React Components to create a seamless and intuitive user experience. Below is an example of the `StakingPanel` component:  

#### **StakingPanel.tsx**  

```tsx  
import React, { useState } from 'react';  
import { calculateDynamicAPR } from '../services/dynamicAPRService';  

const StakingPanel = () => {  
    const [stakeAmount, setStakeAmount] = useState(0);  
    const [apr, setApr] = useState(0);  

    const handleStake = () => {  
        const duration = 12; // Example duration  
        const calculatedAPR = calculateDynamicAPR(stakeAmount, duration);  
        setApr(calculatedAPR);  
    };  

    return (  
        <div>  
            <h2>Staking Panel</h2>  
            <input  
                type="number"  
                value={stakeAmount}  
                onChange={(e) => setStakeAmount(Number(e.target.value))}  
                placeholder="Enter staking amount"  
            />  
            <button onClick={handleStake}>Calculate APR</button>  
            <p>Dynamic APR: {apr}%</p>  
        </div>  
    );  
};  

export default StakingPanel;  
```
